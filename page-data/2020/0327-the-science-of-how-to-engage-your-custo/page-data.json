But few people know the scientific basis for the popular term compulsion loop that refers to the habitual chain of activities that will be repeated enjoyed by the user to cause them to continue the activity. </p>\n<h3>Compulsion Loops.</h3>\n<p>The scientific basis for the compulsion loops, comes from the operational conditioning. Operational conditioning referes to the proces of teaching a behavior by administrating punisment or reward. Because operational conditioning comes from the scientific tradition, it was creating by measuring the results. By scientific research, the secuences of rewards and punishment, were analized and tested to create what is known now as reinforcement programs.</p>\n<p>In video games, the compulsion loops are the strategies created to engage the player to the game. With out this component, the player will not stay playing, no matter how good the music, the story, or the visual art is.</p>\n<p>The common way to create compulsion loops is by changing the level of the difficulty in the game. Lots of game designers say that compulsion loop must be a way to tech the player the rules of the game and the potential strategies. This is true, but do not give us a clear gide in how to apply the compulsion loop t create other apllications for example educational software or educational video games.</p>\n<p>I want to present you a compulsion loop based on the behavioral science.</p>\n<h3>Compulsion loop in Plants vs Zombies.</h3>\n<p>This is the secuence of actions the player ,ust follow in the game:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/ZRSRJT4R/img1.jpg\" alt=\"Compulsion Loop 1\"></p>\n<p>This little training is intended to teach the chain of behaviors to be performed during the game. The interesting thing about the game is that in the main compulsion loop or behavioral chain, the reinforcer is not the suns. THE REINFORCER IS FRUSTRATION. Frustration is associated with the zombie entering the house. Therefore we speak here of a negative reinforcer and of an avoidance strategy as a reinforcement of behavior. The behavioral chain is as follows: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/638yHHWV/img2.jpg\" alt=\"Compulsion Loop 2\"></p>\n<p>Applied to Plants vs Zombies it gives us the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/FHKmgYs3/img3.jpg\" alt=\"Compulsion Loop 3\"></p>\n<p>Of course, there is a lot more to say about this (we have not talked about the balance of the game through reinforcement programs or the purchase of items inside the game through behavioral economics, for example). The term “negative reinforcement” dates from 1938 in the book by B.F. Skinner “In the behavior of organisms”. There are already 78 years of scientific advances in the analysis of behavior (behaviorism) and there is much more that from this point you can analyze this video game.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The science of how to engage your customer","date":"March 27, 2020","description":"A guide to engage users to your digital product","author":"Andres Alba","email":"tensinkusum@hotmail.com","platziUser":"andresalba"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020/0327-the-science-of-how-to-engage-your-custo/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/0326-buenas-practicas-para-la-escritura-de-codigo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tips de buenas prácticas para la escritura de código"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/0328-conviertete-en-un-hacker-de-tu-tiempo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Conviértete en un hacker de tu tiempo"}}}}}
